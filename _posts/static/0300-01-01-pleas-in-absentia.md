## REQUEST TO ENTER A PLEA IN ABSENTIA

###PART I. QUALIFICATIONS
A plea in absentia means that you would like to make a plea of “guilty” or “no contest” on your case without having to come to court. So, if you live out of state or work out of town, a plea in absentia may help you complete your case without appearing in Municipal Court.

If you are represented by an attorney, you are not eligible to plea in absentia through this process. Attorneys may file their plea in absentia directly with the Court. The request form at the bottom of this page is for those defendants not represented by an Attorney.

Please be advised that a plea in absentia request will not be accepted for the following charges:
•	Accidents involving serious bodily injury
•	Aggressive Driving
•	City ordinance violations involving Prostitution or serious damage to persons or property/violence
•	Driving on Revoked/Suspended License/Driving without a valid license
•	Drug related charges
•	DUI
•	Fleeing and Attempting to elude Police
•	Habitual Violator
•	Hit & Run
•	Suspended Registration, and
•	Vehicular Homicide

There may be other charges or acts that may disqualify you from entering a Plea in Absentia. Your driving history and criminal history, if any, will impact whether or not you will be allowed to complete your case without having to appear in Court. You will be notified in writing if your case is rejected.

###PART II. INSTRUCTIONS
The request to enter a plea in absentia should be made on the printable form below. Please print off the form and fill it out. Failure to complete the form properly may result in your request being rejected. When including your personal information, please use a valid address, daytime phone number and email address, if you have one, as we will need to get in touch with you and forward documents to you in order to complete your case.

When filing a request to enter a plea in absentia for a traffic case, please include a photocopy of your current and valid insurance card.
Please file the form at least 10 days prior to your court date. This will prevent a failure to appear being entered on your record which may cause your driving privilege to be suspended and will prevent a monetary penalty from being added to your case.  You may file the form by emailing it to the court at municourt@atlantaga.gov, faxing the form to the court at (404)546-9339, or mailing the form to the court at: 
Municipal Court
Attn: Ombudsman Unit/PIA
150 Garnett Street, SW
Atlanta, GA 30303

Requesting a plea in absentia will reset your case for  6 months. This reset allows us time to complete your case through the mail. Once your form has been received you will be notified with a letter detailing the plea in absentia process. This includes notifying you of your new court date and letting you know of possible documentation that you could be required to provide. Handling your case as a Plea in Absentia is time sensitive so applicants must be timely in fulfilling the necessary requirements.

Please be advised, if your case is rejected at any point during the process, or we are not able to complete your case by your new court date, then you (or an attorney can appear on your behalf) will be required to appear in Atlanta Municipal Court on your new court date to complete your case. Failure to appear for this court appearance may result in the suspension of your privilege to drive and a monetary penalty being added to your case.

If you have access to a computer and have any questions or concerns, you can email us at: plea-in-absentia@atlantaga.gov. If you cannot email us, you can call (404) 658-6618, ext 83255. Please do not email the downloadable request form to the plea in absentia email, the instructions for filing the request form are at the bottom of the form.
