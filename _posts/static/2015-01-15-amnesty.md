## <a name="1"></a>**What is warrant amnesty?**
For a limited time only the Municipal Court of Atlanta is offering warrant amnesty as a goodwill gesture to individuals who face arrest and other penalties due to a past failure to appear (FTA) at court.  Under the program outstanding warrants issued before <b>January 1, 2015</b> will be cancelled and the contempt fee will be waived, thereby allowing individuals to resolve their outstanding court case.  

## <a name="2"></a>**Why is the court doing this now?**
The Municipal Court of Atlanta has thousands of active warrants it is seeking to clear. Now is the time for citizens to take advantage of the warrant set aside and resolve all delinquent court cases. Once the amnesty period ends the City of Atlanta will enforce all active warrants.  Citizens are encouraged to contact the court immediately in order to avoid arrest in the future. 

## <a name="3"></a>**When does the amnesty period begin?**
The six week amnesty period is April 1, 2016 through May 13, 2016.  Court hours of operation are Monday – Friday, 7am – 5:30pm. Amnesty sessions will be held at 9am and 1pm

The court will also open for special special amnesty sessions on:

- Wednesday April 6th and Wednesday April 20th for 6pm court sessions
- Saturday, April 16th at 8am for a 10am court session
